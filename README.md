# Units-Convertor-Andriod-App
This Android Application helps in conversion of different units.

Description:-The main page of the Application gives you an option to choose the area you wanted to do the conversion.
Once you select the area(length or volume) you can give input and select the unit that you are giving input on and then it will calculate and display the conversion in all other units.
This is the same for both length and volume page

Idea:- I when through different similar application in playstore to see how they work and I thought to implement the application I should not only give 1 to 1 conversion but also showing multiple results and units at each conversion

Future update: Include more units and area for conversion also improve the UI
